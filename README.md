## 🔧 Configuration

### Algal Bloom Thresholds

Default NDCI thresholds (customizable in `main.py`):

```python
NDCI_THRESHOLDS = {
    "low": 0.05,      # 5% concentration
    "medium": 0.15,   # 15% concentration  
    "high": 0.25      # 25% concentration (severe bloom)
}
```

**Tuning Recommendations:**
- **Freshwater lakes**: Use defaults (0.05, 0.15, 0.25)
- **Coastal waters**: Lower thresholds (0.03, 0.10, 0.20)
- **Turbid rivers**: Higher thresholds (0.10, 0.20, 0.30)

### Dataset-Specific Notes

**HLS (Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel):**
- Best for: Lakes, coastal areas (30m resolution)
- Bands used: B04 (Red 665nm), B8A (NIR 865nm)
- Revisit: ~2-3 days
- Cloud masking: Fmask QA band

**Sentinel-2:**
- Best for: Detailed coastal monitoring (10-20m)
- Bands: B04 (Red), B08 (NIR), B11 (SWIR for FAI)
- Revisit: ~5 days

**MODIS:**
- Best for: Large-scale ocean monitoring (250-1000m)
- Lower resolution, daily coverage

## � How It Works - Technical Overview

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **📍 Location Selection**
   - User selects water body (quick preset, place name, or coordinates)
   - System validates and converts to bounding box

2. **🔍 Satellite Data Query**
   - Queries NASA CMR API for HLS granules in area and date range
   - Filters by cloud cover and quality metrics
   - Returns available satellite passes

3. **⬇️ Data Acquisition**
   - Concurrent download of up to 8 granules (ThreadPoolExecutor)
   - Authenticated session with NASA Earthdata
   - Streaming downloads with retry logic
   - Caches locally to avoid redundant downloads

4. **🧮 Preprocessing & Analysis**
   ```python
   # Normalize to 0-1 scale using percentiles
   normalized = (band - p5) / (p95 - p5)
   
   # Apply gamma correction (0.85) to enhance bright features
   enhanced = np.power(normalized, 0.85)
   
   # Multi-temporal averaging (stack 8 granules)
   composite = np.nanmean(enhanced_granules, axis=0)
   ```

5. **🎯 Bloom Detection**
   - Apply calibrated thresholds (0.45, 0.65, 0.80)
   - Calculate percentage of area above each threshold
   - Classify severity: CLEAR, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH

6. **📊 Visualization**
   - Generate colored heatmap overlay (light shades for visibility)
   - Overlay on interactive Folium map with satellite base layer
   - Display metrics: severity, area %, mean NDCI, valid pixels

7. **💾 Storage & Export**
   - Save to SQLite database for historical tracking
   - Export analysis reports as CSV
   - Cache results for future reference

### Why It's Fast & Accurate

- **Multi-Temporal Averaging**: Combines multiple satellite passes to reduce noise from clouds, sun glint, and atmospheric effects
- **Percentile Normalization**: Robust to outliers and varying water conditions
- **Gamma Correction**: Enhances contrast for better bloom visibility
- **Windowed Reads**: Memory-efficient processing of large rasters
- **Concurrent Downloads**: Parallel processing speeds up data acquisition
- **Smart Caching**: Avoids re-downloading same granules

---

## � Troubleshooting

### "Credentials Required" Error

**Solution:**
1. Verify `.env` file exists with correct keys
2. Check environment variables are loaded: `echo $NASA_EARTHDATA_USERNAME`
3. Restart Streamlit app after adding credentials
4. For Replit: Use Secrets panel, not `.env` file

### "No Granules Found"

**Possible Causes:**
- Date range too narrow (try 7-14 days)
- Area outside dataset coverage
- Recent dates may not be processed yet (try 3+ days ago)

**Solution:**
- Expand date range
- Try different dataset (HLS has best coverage)
- Check [Earthdata Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/) for data availability

### Download Failures

**Check:**
- Earthdata credentials are valid (try logging in at urs.earthdata.nasa.gov)
- Approved "LP DAAC Data Pool" application
- Network connectivity
- Firewall not blocking NASA domains

### Map Not Displaying

**Check:**
- GIBS service status: [status.earthdata.nasa.gov](https://status.earthdata.nasa.gov/)
- Browser console for JavaScript errors
- Overlay PNG generation logs in terminal

### Processing Pipeline

```
1. Data Acquisition (NASA APIs)
   ├─ Query CMR API for HLS granules
   ├─ Filter by location, date, cloud cover
   └─ Concurrent downloads (ThreadPoolExecutor)

2. Preprocessing
   ├─ Read single-band GeoTIFF files
   ├─ Normalize to 0-1 scale (5th-95th percentile)
   └─ Apply gamma correction (power 0.85)

3. Multi-Temporal Averaging
   ├─ Stack 8 granules from different dates/tiles
   ├─ Compute pixel-wise mean (np.nanmean)
   └─ Generate composite bloom indicator

4. Bloom Detection
   ├─ Apply calibrated thresholds (0.45, 0.65, 0.80)
   ├─ Calculate severity coverage percentages
   └─ Classify: CLEAR/LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH

5. Visualization & Export
   ├─ Generate heatmap overlay (matplotlib)
   ├─ Display on interactive map (Folium + GIBS)
   └─ Provide CSV export and metrics
```

### Algorithm Details

**Normalization & Enhancement**:
```python
# Robust percentile-based normalization
normalized = (band - percentile_5) / (percentile_95 - percentile_5)

# Gamma correction to emphasize bright features (algae)
enhanced = np.power(normalized, 0.85)

# Multi-temporal averaging reduces noise
composite = np.nanmean(enhanced_granules, axis=0)
```

**Calibrated Thresholds** (tuned for normalized 0-1 scale):
- **CLEAR**: < 0.45 (normal water)
- **LOW**: 0.45 - 0.65 (early bloom)
- **MEDIUM**: 0.65 - 0.80 (developing bloom)
- **HIGH**: > 0.80 (severe bloom)
